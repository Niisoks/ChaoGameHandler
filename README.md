# ChaoGameHandler
A desktop app that reads the sa2b chao save and turns it into a password for use with a mobile application

# Stuff that doesnt work right now
Exporting the chao save will currently only export 4 variables to the QR code as the rest havent been implemented
The program currently only imports and exports into chao slot 1
1&2 digit numbers do not work in the chao stats section because i wrote it with a misunderstanding of the endianess.
All variables do not have a toString
